Gringo Caliente is a MERN Stack hot sauce marketplace that is fully responsive, uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication and redux for state managment.  Shoppers can create profiles which will save previous orders and show the status of their orders.  Users can be upgraded to Admins where they will be able to view, edit, and delete all products, user, reviews and orders.  These admin pages are protected and cannot be viewed unless a user is authenticated as an admin.
